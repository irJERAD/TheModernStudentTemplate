The purpose of having a TheModernStudentTemplate as well as a TheModernStudent project is two fold:

1. The Template project will maintain a near exact structure to the theme and assemble easy. TheModernStudent project, however, will strive to customize in both nomenclature and design

2. It will be much quicker to develop along the Template project. It will be easy to step back and fix mistakes in the Template project. And I will get a product up and running much easier in a template version

### So why even have a custom project?

The experience of building this site as well as the tools to manage it and then have to keep it all together. That not even to mention the content.
This project will push me harder and harder the longer I am able to stay with it.
